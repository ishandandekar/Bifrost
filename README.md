# BiFrost

:wave: Hello and welcome to **BiFrost** code repository. This is a short and simple Artificial Intelligence project. **BiFrost** helps to make your commute easier by showing you the shortest route to take from your start to your destination.

## Introduction

**BiFrost** is an AI application, which gives an optimal route between two places, based on the time taken for the journey. The algorithm for path optimization, is A-star search algorithm. The idea behind this project is to give the user better transportation options, when travelling using public transport. For example, if a person wants to go from Point A to Point B, you have multiple options. The algorithm then calculates a path considering the time taken for the journey to get the best path.  
In the early development stages, we used Mumbai(Maharashtra, India) and Navi Mumbai(Maharashtra, India). We got this data using the famous mobile app **M-Indicator**. The app shows real time details about train timings, which we felt was the best way to retrieve the data.  
This network of railway, is imitated as a **Graph** data structure. This made it easier to add the nodes (or stops/destinations). Further, if there is any development on creating better lines for transportation, adding to the network will be very easy.
We did this project as a part of our bachelor's degree for the Applied AI subject.
