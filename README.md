### Problem Statement

<img src="InkedMumbai rail map.jpg" alt="isolated" width="650" height="600"/>

The idea behind this project is to give the user better transportation options (in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai). For example, if a person wants to go from Borivali to Panvel, you have multiple options. The above map covers some of them. The above image only contains the rail network, but you can also imagine bus and taxi networks too. So, considering all the options, and optimising the time taken by the user for to travel and cost of that commute, we must show the best option among them. This will require using search algorithms such as a-star search.

### Development phases

- **Start**: Approaching interested python developers to contribute to this idea.
- **Groudwork**: The original plan is to cover atleast the rail (including metro and mono-rail) network of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The whole map will be represented as a graph data structure.
- **Search**: Devise a search algorithm which will give the quickest way from station A to station B optimizing the time taken.
- **App**: Create an Android/iOS or a Web app using framework of mutual choice (Streamlit, Flask, Django etc.).
- **Add timings**: Using an API or some other source, extract the timings of the local trains and add a feature in app to get the trains traveling through that route, just like the famous app m-indicator.
- **Add various transport**: Use Ola, Uber and bus services like BEST to show cost along with the time taken from point A to point B. Give the user and option to choose between them.
- **Create a pipeline**: There is constant developement in the city. Create a pipeline to quickly add a new line (of BEST, Metro or local).

**This marks the end of the project.**
